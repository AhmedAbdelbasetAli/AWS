# Security in AWS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a wide range of tools and features to help you secure your cloud environment. Security in AWS follows the **shared responsibility model**, where AWS is responsible for security *of* the cloud, and you are responsible for security *in* the cloud.

## üîê Shared Responsibility Model

| Responsibility | AWS | Customer |
|----------------|-----|----------|
| Infrastructure security | ‚úÖ Compute, Storage, Networking | ‚ùå |
| Identity and Access Management (IAM) | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Guest Operating Systems | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Applications running on AWS | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Data encryption (at rest & in transit) | ‚ùå (but offers services) | ‚úÖ |
| Firewall configuration | ‚ùå (but offers tools like Security Groups, NACLs) | ‚úÖ |

## üõ°Ô∏è Key AWS Security Services

### 1. **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
- Manages users, groups, roles, and permissions.
- Enforces least privilege access.
- Supports multi-factor authentication (MFA).

**Best Practices:**
- Never use root account for daily tasks.
- Rotate credentials regularly.
- Use IAM roles for EC2 instead of long-term keys.

---

### 2. **Amazon GuardDuty**
- Threat detection service that monitors for malicious activity.
- Analyzes VPC flow logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs.

---

### 3. **AWS WAF & Shield**
- **WAF**: Web Application Firewall to protect against web exploits (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **Shield**: Protects against DDoS attacks (Standard is free; Advanced requires subscription).

---

### 4. **AWS Config**
- Tracks configuration changes over time.
- Helps ensure compliance with internal policies and regulatory standards.

---

### 5. **Amazon Inspector**
- Automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices.

---

### 6. **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)**
- Centralized service for creating and managing cryptographic keys.
- Integrates with many AWS services for encryption at rest and in transit.

---

### 7. **AWS Secrets Manager & Parameter Store (SSM)**
- Manage secrets like database passwords, API keys securely.
- Secrets Manager automatically rotates secrets.

---

### 8. **CloudTrail**
- Logs all API calls made in your AWS account.
- Enables governance, compliance, and operational auditing.

---

### 9. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Security**
- **Security Groups**: Act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances.
- **Network ACLs**: Stateless firewall rules at the subnet level.
- **Private Subnets**: For sensitive resources not exposed to the internet.
- **VPC Endpoints**: Privately connect to AWS services without going over the public internet.

---

### 10. **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**
- Provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates for use with AWS services.

---

### 11. **AWS Macie**
- Uses machine learning to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data (like PII) in S3.

---

### 12. **AWS Audit Manager**
- Helps continuously assess compliance with regulations and industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC2, HIPAA).

## üîí Security Best Practices in AWS

1. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for all IAM users, especially the root account.
2. **Use IAM Roles** instead of long-term credentials for EC2, Lambda, etc.
3. **Encrypt all sensitive data** using AWS KMS or other encryption mechanisms.
4. **Monitor activity** using CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and Config.
5. **Limit public access** to resources like S3 buckets, RDS, and EC2.
6. **Regularly rotate credentials** and remove unused access keys.
7. **Implement network segmentation** using VPCs and subnets.
8. **Automate compliance checks** using AWS Config and Audit Manager.
9. **Set up alarms** using CloudWatch for suspicious behavior.
10. **Follow the principle of least privilege** in IAM policies.

## üìä Compliance & Certifications

AWS complies with global standards such as:
- ISO/IEC 27001
- SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3
- GDPR
- HIPAA
- PCI DSS Level 1
- NIST
- CSA STAR

---

## üß™ Tools for Testing and Monitoring

- **AWS Trusted Advisor**: Provides real-time guidance on best practices.
- **AWS Security Hub**: Centralizes security alerts and compliance status.
- **Amazon Detective**: Helps analyze security issues by visualizing data.
- **AWS Artifact**: On-demand access to AWS compliance reports.
