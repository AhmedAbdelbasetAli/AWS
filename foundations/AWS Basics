### üí∞ Pricing Model

AWS uses a **pay-as-you-go** model:
- You only pay for what you use.
- No upfront costs.
- Free Tier available for many services (ideal for beginners/testing).

### üß≠ AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS has data centers around the world, grouped into:
- **Regions:** Geographic areas (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`).
- **Availability Zones (AZs):** Isolated locations within a region for redundancy.
- **Edge Locations:** Points of presence used by AWS CDN (CloudFront).

### üîí Security in AWS

- **Shared Responsibility Model:**
  - **AWS** secures the infrastructure (hardware, software, facilities).
  - **You** secure your data, applications, and configurations.

- Best practices include:
  - Use IAM roles and policies.
  - Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
  - Regularly audit with AWS Config and CloudTrail.
